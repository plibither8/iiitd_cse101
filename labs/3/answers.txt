Q1. What is the use of triple quotes? How did it help us in the above-illustrated case in Task 1?
Ans.
	Triple quotes represent _string literals_. String literals are values that have the datatype as strings,
	but give us the ability to easily represent multiline strings having special characters.

	In the specific use-case in Task 1, they represent multiline comments that hold information regarding
	what the function does, what the parameters and what value the function returns.

Q2. What is the difference between
	1. import xyz
	2. from xyz import abc
Ans.
	`import xyz` imports the complete file as one module that holds all functions/variables defined in that module.
	To access a function/variable from that module, one has to use the 'dot' operator like: `xyz.abc`

	`from xyz import abc` directly imports the variable/function named 'abc' from the module 'xyz', so that it can
	be accessed without the dot operator.
